# IOT-Heart-rate-Monitoring-system

This project Aims at providing a precise 24/7 Compact Heart rate monitoring Module using a good Heart rate sensor, so the sample project is based upon the 
Arduino Uno MicroProcessor board which is interfaced with the "AD-8232" Heart rate sensor.
### Project Overview
The Basic idea is to use the Arduino Uno board to get the important information from the Heart Rate sensor module and send out this Heart-Beat information in case of
a High value/Anamoly is Detected Arduino connected to WiFi sends out a "Emergency E-Mail" Intimation to User's E-Mail ID immediately.
For further processing and Diagnosis the Same graph is sent to a Back-End Server where it is processed and Fourier Transform is applied in MATLAB software

a Graph to the PC/Mobile connected to the same
